# Chess AI
This is a basic chess AI. I use chessboard.js for visualising the board and chess.js for move validation.
It finds the relative chess piece value of the board and makes moves depending on it. To narrow down the moves
it uses minimax algorithm along with alpha beta pruning to significantly improve the speed.
